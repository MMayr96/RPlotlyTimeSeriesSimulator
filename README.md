# RPlotlyTimeSeriesSimulator
This project showcases the performance of plotly in the use-case of splitted interactive time-series, where the x-axis is shared between plots.
The plots are generated in a WebGL context (scattergl), enabling high amounts of datapoints to be plotted. Beaware, that with the use of scattergl, one cannot use R Studio for visualizing the plots - use Chrome or Firefox.
